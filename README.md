## My process
  I've build this card without using CSS Flexbox or CSS Grid to improve my CSS positioning skills.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned
In the process of building this website I've improved my CSS positioning skills, using my knowledges regarding positioning elements absolute and relative, and also I've revsited the transform property.

### Continued development

I would like to coninue to build projects in this manner in order to improve my existing skills.

### Useful resources

- [MDN position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position) - This helped me to position the elements within the card.
- [MDN transform property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the transform property. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
